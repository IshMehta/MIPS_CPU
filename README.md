# MIPS_CPU
 
Designed a simplified version of a 5 stage pipelined CPU based on the 32 bit MIPS RISC instruction-set architecture (ISA). 
Developed during the Fall 2020 Computer Organisation and Design course at Pennsylvania State University, this project is an implementation of a pipelined 32 bit MIPS processor. This implementation is based on a limited ISA. 

## Pipelining
* Instruction Fecth (IF)
* Instruction Decode (ID)
* Execute (EX)
* Memory Access (MEM)
* Writeback (WB)
